### What is

This is a game made from [this tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/course/create-a-complete-2d-arena-survival-roguelike-game-in-godot-4) on how to make a vampire-survivors like game and learn the basics of working with godot and GDscript. It is bad, but an unfiltered look at how the process of completing that tutorial works, and the steps afterword that produced a working (and hopefully fun) game on multiple platforms.

### Why is

1. To learn how to make a game in a modern framework.
2. To sell it once the tutorial is done (for donos).
3. To express humor and humility and force myself to actually work through the steps of publishing *a thing* even though I **know** it's trash.
4. To turn a tutorial you normally throw away into a foot in the door of itch.io and steam, and a 5 minute experience that isn't trash.
5. To learn various tools for making an actually good game.

But mostly to get a feel for doing game development with more of my time.
